I have a Flask project structure attached, and I need assistance generating the necessary Flask application scripts. Currently, the scripts are all empty. Here are my requirements:

1. Implement user registration and authorization functionality.
2. After successful login, users should be able to enter their vk_api_key and vk_group_id.
3. Develop pages with SMM (Social Media Management) functionality.
4. Minimize the usage of additional Flask modules to keep the project lightweight.
5. Please help me achieve these requirements while keeping the implementation simple and efficient.
6. Use  SQLAlchemy and BCrypt  to store data including  user session and sensitive information (like vk_api_key, user password etc)
7.An Flask application should be created at __init__.py.
8. SMM functionality should include setting vk_apy_key and vk_group_id and working with SMM content - generation, observing statistics.
9. The structure should be modular - do not put every functionality into one moulde. Work out it carefully
